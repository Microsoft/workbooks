The following non-definition expression-terminating cells should not render any results as they are either `void`or awaited as a non-generic `Task`.

```csharp
await Task.Delay (1000)
```

```csharp
void Void () { }
```

```csharp
Void ()
```

```csharp
Action a = () => { };
```

```csharp
a ()
```

```csharp
var task = Task.Delay (1000)
```

```csharp
await task
```

The following non-definition expression cells terminate with a renderable expression:

```csharp
1
```

```csharp
true
```

```csharp
(1 + 2)
```

```csharp
Math.Pow (10, 10)
```

```csharp
Task<int> RandomAsync () => Task.FromResult (new Random ().Next ())
```

```csharp
await RandomAsync ()
```

```csharp
Console.WriteLine ("void"); "not void"
```
