# Smoky

This workbook provides a quick regression test of a number of features.

## Tuples

```csharp
var tuple = (name: "Aaron", age: 12)
```

## Dynamic

This cell should be skipped on iOS.

```csharp
dynamic dynamicTuple = tuple;
dynamicTuple.Item1 + " is " + dynamicTuple.Item2
```

## Basic NuGet

```csharp
#r "Newtonsoft.Json"
```

```csharp
using Newtonsoft.Json
```

```csharp
JsonConvert.SerializeObject (tuple)
```

## Async

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    Console.WriteLine (i);
    await Task.Delay (250);
}
```

## Agent Crash Recovery

> ℹ️ This cell will intentionally terminate the agent process. It should result in the client becoming disconnected and should show an error message in the result area of the cell indicating so. Re-running the workbook after the disconnect should result in re-connection and execution up to but not including the cell which resulted in the initial termination.

```csharp
Environment.Exit (0)
```
